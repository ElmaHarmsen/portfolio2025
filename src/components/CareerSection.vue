          I am currently pursuing an âœ¨ inspiring design career âœ¨ in the nordics. I have previously
          worked with User Interface Design as well as Web Development, and I have just recently
          completed a masterâ€™s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the Uppsala University. I
          would like to continue working with User Interface Design and Interaction Design, possibly
          expanding the scope to User Research and Usability Testing, and I am open to Web
          Development as well. In my next employment I am looking for companies offering full-time
          and on-site or hybrid positions in a collaborative and professional work environment. If I
          have captured your interest I would be delighted to hear from you ðŸ™Œ
