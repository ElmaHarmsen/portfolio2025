          I am currently pursuing an inspiring design and development career in the nordics. I have
          previously worked with User Interface Design as well as Web Development, and I have just
          recently completed a masterâ€™s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the Uppsala
          University. I would like to continue working with User Interface Design and Interaction
          Design, possibly expanding the scope to User Research and Usability Testing, and I am open
          to Frontend Development as well. In my next employment I am looking for companies offering
          full-time and on-site or hybrid positions in a collaborative and professional work
          environment. If I have captured your interest I would be delighted to hear from you.
