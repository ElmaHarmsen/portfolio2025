              We advanced awareness on the negative impacts of fast fashion on the environment, and
              introduced a new approach to reduce fashion waste in local communities. Through an
              extensive design process including ideation, analysis, prototyping and testing, we
              conceptualised a solution to the problem and evaluated its desirability with the
              stakeholders. We were an international team of five members and I found that our
              collaboration during the project was both successful and inspiring âœ¨ We spent much
              time sharing knowledge and skills within the team, delegating tasks equally among the
              team members, and refining our design choices to match our ideas.
